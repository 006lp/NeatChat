NeatChat is a new version based on NextChat with multiple optimizations. NeatChat currently has three branches: main branch, mini branch, and preview branch.

The preview branch is a preview branch of the main branch, which will be merged into the main branch after stabilization. The mini branch is a separate simplified branch (for mini branch, please visit [NeatChat-Mini](https://github.com/tianzhentech/NeatChat-Mini)).

The mission of the main branch is to optimize UI and add new features, eventually evolving independently from NextChat. The mini branch will make minor adjustments and reductions based on NextChat, closely following NextChat's pace. Only particularly important features from the main branch will be passed down to the mini branch. Due to the different purposes of the main and mini branches, there will be two sets of UI.

# Build Notes
Since the preview branch will be periodically merged into the main branch, to avoid creating an unstable experience and wasting too much build time, all platforms will only build the main branch. This means only official versions will be built rather than preview versions. For preview updates, please download the source code to experience them yourself.
